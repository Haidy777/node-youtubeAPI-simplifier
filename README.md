# node-youtubeAPI-simplifier
The Youtube-API probably isn't the simplest api in the world.
So why isn't there a simplifier? Well, don't worry, now there is one :)

I already implemented a bunch of functions regarding channels, playlists and (a basic & simple) video search.

Examples can be found in the examples directory and at the end of this readme.
